# Raspberry-Pi-Mega-Cluster
Welcome to the repository for the Mega Cluster of Raspberry Pi compute modules! Here you will find all the information necessary to build your own mega cluster of Raspberry Pi compute modules. This is all theoretical planning and a Proof of Concept of sorts. This is by no means cost-effective in any way. **NOTE:** This project is by no means cost-effective and costs a lot to maintain. This can be scaled up or down depending on what application you are trying to deploy. I am not liable for anything that happens if someone decides to purchase all the parts necessary. The guide may not be complete at the time of posting. I am not responsible for this. With that out of the way, let's get right into it.
