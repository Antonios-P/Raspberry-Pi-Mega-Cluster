Respository for The Mega Cluster of Raspberry Pi compute modules. This is all theoretical planning and a Proof of Concept of sorts. This is by no means cost effective in any way. **NOTE:** This project is by no means cost effective and costs a lot to maintain. I am not liable for anything that happens if someone decides to purchase all the partse necessary. It may not be complete at the time of posting. I am not responsible for this. With that out of the way, let's get righ into it.
