***Below You will find everything related to CAD, dimensions, drawings, and where things are supposed to go and how they have to be aligned.***

* **Turing Pi**
  * Grid Layout per Layer: 2 wide x 4 deep (as seen from the front of the rack)
    * there is 9 inches of space at the back for things like power supplies and cables
  * For every 5 layers of Turing Pis, 1 48-port switch needs to be installed
    * This can be repeated 7 times per rack to use the full potential of the 42U server rack. *2 racks will be used.*
    
    *insert picture of the grid layout and the layer layout here*
    
All CAD files can be found [here](resources/dimensions/CAD-Files).
